In this repository are examples of code that I have written
below I will explain what each script does

Billingcode.py:         This is a script that I wrote for myself to generate bills for labor and reciepts.
                        This script takes input for each category of labor and adds them together
                        to get a total and then generates an itemized bill as a pdf.

insurance_anaylisis.py: This script uses the insurance.csv file to create a pandas dataframe and 
                        analyze the data to generate insights.

Linear_reg_example.py:  This script uses the diabetes.csv file to create a dataframe and compare bmi
                        to blood pressure with a scatter plot and then use statsmodels.api to create
                        an ordinary least squares line and then plot it over the scatter plot

syslogproject.py:       This script was written for a google certificate course project, It takes a
                        system log, which I simulated in the test.txt file, and it parses it making
                        two csv files, error_message.csv lists each error and the frequency they occur
                        and user_statistics.csv lists the users and each INFO and ERROR entry for each
                        user.
